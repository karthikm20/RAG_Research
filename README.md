# vector_db1
This is a basic vector database built from scratch! 

Primary intent is to explore in and out of the vector database including indexing, embedding storage, retrieval techniques etc. 
As the project develops I intend to update this read me file with the findings and innovations in retrieval techniques.
As of now retrievals avalable to check out: 
## Querying :
1) Dense Retrieval: Dot product calculation and similarity match of entire query.
2) Sparse retrieval: Cosine Similarity checks the matching words and retrieve the embeddings.
3) Hybrid Approach: Sparse + dense.
4) Any other
   
## Indexing to explore: 
1) Naive indeing
2) Hierarchial Indexing- kd-tree methods
3) Knowledge Graphs
